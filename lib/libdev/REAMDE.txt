This directory contains a copy of the sources for libdev files
The original location inside the SDCC source package is
   sdcc/src/sdcc/device/lib/pic16/libdev

The .c files have been compiled through the mios wrapper
(mios-sdcc and mios-gpasm) to ensure, that FSR1 and FSR0 are swapped


The resulting libpic*.lib file should be copied to $MIOS_PATH/lib,
and is referenced by common.mk by default


Note: the binaries are part of the release package, under normal circumstances
you don't need to re-create it!
