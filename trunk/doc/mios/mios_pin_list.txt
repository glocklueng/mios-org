MIOS Pin List
=============

This list gives you an oversight over the pin usage of MIOS. 
See also the schematic of the MBHP_CORE module as reference: 
   http://www.ucapps.de/mbhp/mbhp_core.pdf


The pins are divided into following classes:

   o Class A: analog inputs, which can be optionally used as digital inputs
     or outputs like demonstrated in the j5_dout and j5_din example if the
     MIOS_AIN and MIOS_MF driver are not used

   o Class B: digital pin which is free for applications if neither the MIOS_AIN
     multiplex driver, nor the MIOS_MF driver is active
     Also free if MIOS_AIN doesn't run in mux mode

   o Class C: digital pin which is free for applications if the 
     MIOS_AIN multiplex driver isn't active

   o Class D: digital pin which is free for applications if the
     MIOS_MF driver isn't active

   o Class E: digital pin which is free for an application if the MIOS_SRIO
     driver isn't active. Can also be shared with other devices if the
     application accesses the pin from an interrupt service routine or
     if it disables all interrupts for a short time (< 300 uS!)

   o Class F: digital pin which is free for an application if the MIOS_SRIO
     driver isn't active.

   o Class G: free pin which can be used by the application without
     any restrictions

   o Class H: digital pin which can be shared with other modules (LCD/IIC/...)
     Shouldn't be used from an interrupt service routine

   o Class I: digital pin, exclusive for LCD

   o Class J: digital IO pin, can be shared with the LCD data lines as IO
     pins so long J15:E is low (means: MIOS doesn't execute a MIOS_LCD function)
     Shouldn't be used from an interrupt service routine

   o Class K: see description
