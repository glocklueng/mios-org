
MIDIO128 V2.1d
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o MIDIO SysEx ID is now automatically derived from the MIOS Device ID


MIDIO128 V2.1b
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o the initial polarity of "toggle status" was wrong


MIDIO128 V2.1a
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o "program change" and "channel preassure" now sent correctly

   o the 42th and 84th DIN event now sent correctly

   o proper initialization for the case that the DOUTs are inverted 
     or the DINs are not inverted

   o change in default meta event handler (midio_meta.inc): 
     nothing will be sent if first byte is 0xff


MIDIO128 V2.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o three new SysEx commands have been implemented to simplify
     the configuration data up- and download. It's a block
     oriented format and therefore doesn't require delays between
     every byte anymore. This means, that data uploads can
     now also be realized without the use of MIDI-Ox so long the
     SysEx tool allows to insert delays between every block
     ("Delay after F7") - it should be 750 mS - thats the
     same requirement like for MIOS uploads.

   o the mk_midio128_syx.pl script has been updated to support the
     new upload format. It can be downloaded from here:

MIDIO128 V2.0 - MIOS based version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o the complete MIDIO128 firmware has been ported to MIOS and is
     now running on a PIC18F452. For new projects it's recommented 
     to switch to the PIC18F452 because of the higher flexibility, 
     but also the update of an existing MIDIbox to MIOS makes sense 
     due to the new features - just only the processor and the 
     crystal have to be changed.
