How about a low-budget MIDI controller with just one rotary encoder, one 2x20 LCD and 6 buttons to control your whole equipment? ;-)



This application is just a demonstrator and far from perfection, but it's already usefull as MIDI remote device for Cubase/Logic/Whatever or softsynths like Reaktor. Up to 255 MIDI parameters can be controlled, organized in 51 banks. All parameters and banks can be labled for a better oversight. Incoming events will be registered, means: the internal values will be updated automatically - presumed that the MIDI host application sends the parameters through MIDI Out when you load a new song, a new patch, or move a virtual fader/knob.
