MIDIbox64SEQ V2.4a/b/c
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o if not in songmode, the Fwd and Rew button can now be used to
     increment/decrement the menu value. 
     This is a nice alternative possibility for "fine adjusting" values
     without the datawheel

   o the clock rate of the external clock pin is now selectable from
     96 ppqn to 24/13 ppqn in the BPM menu - just press one of the 16
     general purpose buttons. With 96 ppqn the clock output is 
     permanently 1 (thats not a bug)
     24 ppqn is the standard setting (GP button #4)

   o a new option has been added which allows synchronized pattern 
     switching, the pattern will be changed with the next measure 
     (after the 16 steps of the "master track" have been processed)

   o a new option has been added for arpeggiator mode which avoids
     that the track position will be reset if no note/chord is played

   o there is a new "MBSEQ Options" menu page which allows to select
     these two new features online


MIDIbox64SEQ V2.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o the arpeggiator has been enhanced by "Multi-Arp" events
     The details are described under http://www.ucapps.de/midibox_seq_tutorial4.html

   o a 24ppqn clock output is now supported to synchronize with vintage 
     drum machines and sequencers
     The signal is available at pin #15 (RC0, CORE::J6::RC)


MIDIbox64SEQ V2.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o the clock can now be divided by BPM/1,2,3,..15,16 for each track
     separately. Before this change it was BPM/1,2,4,8,16,32,64
     It's possible to switch back to the old behaviour with the
     DEFAULT_BPM_DIVIDER_BEHAVIOUR switch in main.asm

   o the song menu handling has been overworked:
     - for 2*2x40 LCD option, there is now an additional info screen
       at the right side (second display)
     - song mode can be enabled/disabled in song menu by pressing
       the SONG button (again)
     - if not in song mode, the pattern set will be changed
       immediately (see usecases below for the reason)
     - song position now named A1..P8 instead of 1..128 for easier
       orientation
     - song positions are now divided into parts A..P, each part
       consists of 8 pattern sets, each pattern set can be looped
       up to 16 times.
     - song number, song position, loop/jumps now controllable with
       the general purpose buttons

   Usecases of the new song handling:

     a) for song mode enter the song menu and press the button twice.
        Press the "A" button + one of the 16 GP buttons to select the song
        Press the "B" button + one of the 16 GP buttons to select the part
        -> the sequencer will change to the part immediately, if the
        sequencer was not running before, it will be started automatically

     b) this allows you to divide a song into multiple parts. At the
        end of a part, you can either set a jump to the first step
        of the part (so that the part loops), or you can set a jump
        to the next part.

        Note: if a song part consists of 8 song positions, it is not possible
        to set an additional jump. The sequencer will jump to the next
        part automatically (this ensures compatibility)

     c) it's always possible to change the part during the sequencer
        is running - it won't affect the realtime behaviour :)
        This allows you to change between breaks/fills/chorus or
        whatever during a live session

     d) If you don't want to use the song mode, the new handling is 
        still useful for you - it allows to save up to 128 pattern
        sets within a song.
        Press the "A" button + one of the 16 GP buttons to select the song
        Press the "B" button + one of the 16 GP buttons to select the part
        (this already provides a quick access to 16 pattern sets)
        Turn the datawheel to select pos 1..8 within a part

        Similar to song mode, changes will take place immediately
        without affecting the sequencer timings. The selected pattern
        set will loop endless until you are changing to a new one
  

MIDIbox64SEQ V2.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o a drum mode has been implemented which allows to play three drum lines
     per track (makes up to 48 drum lines which can be played in parallel)
     In this mode, each layer contains one drum line
     Limitations: each line has a dedicated note and gatelength. Only
     two velocity values can be specified (normal and accent)
     The accents can be set when the FAST button is activated
     More details are described under http://www.ucapps.de/midibox_seq_tutorial3.html

   o single events can now be triggered multiple times (up to 4 times per step)
     with a delay value of 1-31. The number of triggers and the delay can
     be selected in the gatelength layer
     This feature allows to play doubled, triplet and quadrupled notes,
     which is especially useful for drumrolls, ratterbeats and flams
     More details are described under http://www.ucapps.de/midibox_seq_tutorial3.html

     Note: the new definition of the gatelength makes old patterns
     incompatible to previous releases (better to do it now than
     never) - the gatelength has to be divided by 4 in old patterns

   o a humanizer function has been added which allows to add/subtract 
     random values from the 2nd MIDI byte (e.g. Note), from the 3rd
     MIDI byte (e.g. Velocity, CC value, Aftertouch...) and from
     the gatelength.
     The humanizer mode and intensity can be selected in the Groove menu

   o two additional gate trigger pins are now available for the AOUT option.
     The 3rd gate is located at pin RC0 (CORE::J6::RC)
     The 4th gate is located at pin RC1 (CORE::J6::SC)
     These pins are only used when no AIN multiplexers are connected 
     (which is normaly the case when no pots are used)



MIDIbox64SEQ V2.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o Two morphing modes have been integrated into the application:

     "Smooth morphing": Layer A, B and C (on Notes: Note number,
     velocity, gatelength - on CC: CC number, value and gatelength)
     are faded smoothly from one to another pattern.
     The morph position between these two scenes can be controlled 
     from the Morph menu, or with the modulation wheel of an external
     keyboard

     "Threshold morphing" - especially for Note events (Drum patterns):
     Note and Velocity (Layer A and B) are switched to an alternative 
     track once the morph position (controlled from the menu or with 
     a modulation wheel) passes the so called threshold level of the 
     played step.
     The threshold can be set for each step separately in Layer C
     (normaly used for the gatelength).
     In other words: the threshold levels of every step are used to determine
     at which morphing level the sequencer should play the note from 
     another track
     The gatelength itself is fixed in this mode.

   o Transpose/Arpeggiator hold key function improved

   o Transpose works also with CC events now

   o Arpeggiator view now always correctly displayed independent from the 
     track direction

   o Fast button now also speeds up the datawheel

   o gate signals of CV out now handled correctly on overlapping notes

   o IMPORTANT: from now on, the SCLK input of the AOUT module has to
     be connected to port J10:MD (PIC Pin #28/RD5) of the core module

     The use of MIOS V1.7 is highly recommented, you will notice
     brighter LEDs
