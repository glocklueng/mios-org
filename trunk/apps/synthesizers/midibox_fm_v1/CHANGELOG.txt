MIDIboxFM V1.1c
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o base address of encoder table corrected (encoders were 
     not working on new installations)


MIDIboxFM V1.1b
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o support for direct RAM buffer access via SysEx
     (-> see midibox_fm_sysex_implementation.txt)

   o support for AOUT_NG module


MIDIboxFM V1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o this version requires MIOS V1.9 or higher!
     It won't run with older MIOS versions, since the address space
     >= 0x7c00 is allocated

   o AOUT mapping now stored into first BankStick when the AOUT
     menu is exit. The values will be restored during boot phase.

   o an alternative view for the main page has been integrated, which
     shows a little bit more details about an instrument (especially
     the complete patch name) instead of cryptic numbers.
     You can switch to the old ("full") view within the CFG menu.
     The default view can be specified in the main.asm/setup_*.asm
     file

   o the internal WT editor now allows to modify the parameters
     of a whole track at once, this speeds up the initialisation
     of a new WT sequence. Just select the step position beyond 31
     ("All" will be print) and modify the Mod, #1, #2 or #3 column

   o the WT editor now marks parameters with a '!' so long they haven't
     been stored in EEPROM

   o some minor bugfixes and improvements have been made


MIDIboxFM V1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o Initial Release
