MIDIboxFM V1.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o PIC18F4685 only: Wavetables are stored in RAM for non-destructive editing

   o name is now entered when a patch should be stored in SAVE menu

   o random generator now copies new patch into all selected instruments

   o fixed waveform display in drum pages


MIDIboxFM V1.2a
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o fixed save function


MIDIboxFM V1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o The firmware now supports the PIC18F4685.
     The additional memory is used for new features:
     - Nils added some nice looking special characters for LFO, OSC waveforms
       and operator connections
     - Wilba added some special CS handling code for sammichFM
     - TK added a random patch generator (-> RND page at the end of the menu)

   o Instrument LEDs are flashing now whenever a gate of an assigned oscillator
     is triggered

   o added possibility to play a note from the CS:
     press CFG + Instrument Key 1/2/3/4 to trigger a note

   o bugfix for finetune in upper range


MIDIboxFM V1.1e
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o fixed INS display bug in AOUT page


MIDIboxFM V1.1d
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o built for MIOS V1.9g (or higher) to support new encoder types.
     Rotary encoders won't work with older MIOS versions!

   o a new SysEx command allows to store the current patch into 
     EEPROM/BankStick.

     It can be used of no Control Surface is available - parameters
     can be changed via CC or SysEx

   o volume parameters now updated immediately on CC #28..#31 changes

   o reduced intensity of LFO/EG5 Pitch Depth parameter


MIDIboxFM V1.1c
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o base address of encoder table corrected (encoders were 
     not working on new installations)


MIDIboxFM V1.1b
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o support for direct RAM buffer access via SysEx
     (-> see midibox_fm_sysex_implementation.txt)

   o support for AOUT_NG module


MIDIboxFM V1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o this version requires MIOS V1.9 or higher!
     It won't run with older MIOS versions, since the address space
     >= 0x7c00 is allocated

   o AOUT mapping now stored into first BankStick when the AOUT
     menu is exit. The values will be restored during boot phase.

   o an alternative view for the main page has been integrated, which
     shows a little bit more details about an instrument (especially
     the complete patch name) instead of cryptic numbers.
     You can switch to the old ("full") view within the CFG menu.
     The default view can be specified in the main.asm/setup_*.asm
     file

   o the internal WT editor now allows to modify the parameters
     of a whole track at once, this speeds up the initialisation
     of a new WT sequence. Just select the step position beyond 31
     ("All" will be print) and modify the Mod, #1, #2 or #3 column

   o the WT editor now marks parameters with a '!' so long they haven't
     been stored in EEPROM

   o some minor bugfixes and improvements have been made


MIDIboxFM V1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o Initial Release
