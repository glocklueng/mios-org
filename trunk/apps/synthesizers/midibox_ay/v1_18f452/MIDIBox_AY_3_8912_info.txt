The MIDIbox AY 3 8912 
---------------------

The MIDIbox AY 3 8912 is stuffed with a General Instruments AY-3-8912 sound chip. 
The AY-3-8912 is a 3-voice Programmable Sound Generator (PSG). The AY 3 8912 PSG contains 3 
independent channels (A, B and C), a single noise generator, and a single envelope generator. 
Each channel includes a square wave tone generator and is capable of mixing any combination 
of the output from its respective tone generator with the noise generator and the envelope
generator. Output from each of the 3 channels is then mixed together to produce the final audio output. 
The MIDIbox AY 3 8912 Control Surface based on a C64 Keyboard and a 4Ã—16 LCD.
