MIDIbox MM V2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o the complete application has been ported to C
     More infos about how to compile the code can be found under
        http://www.ucapps.de/mios_c.html



MIDIbox MM V1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initial version which emulates the Motormix nearly completely:

   o eight motorfaders send and receive position data with 10 bit resolution
   o eight touch sensors can be connected
   o eight virtual pots (rotary encoders) send relative events
   o one additional rotary encoder ("jog wheel") sends relative events
   o all 67 button functions are available
   o all 72 LED functions are available
   o two status digits (7 segment digits)
   o messages are displayed on a 2x40 LCD (only!)

Additionally this application provides following functions:
   o a dirty hack makes it possible to add eight LEDrings to the V-Pots.
     However, the host application must send the absolute V-Pot position 
     to the display - currently it only works with Sonar, Cubase doesn't
     get use of the so called "rotary pointer" (see Motormix specification)
   o a layer function which allows to map Motormix button functions and LEDs
     to a smaller number of buttons (additional "Shift Key")
   o 128 general purpose controllers can be send with the V-Pots in
     GPC mode
   o optional "dont-send-if-touchsensor-not-pressed" function (disabled by
     default to avoid confusion, but heavily recommented if touchsensors
     available)

Following function of the original Motormix is not implemented:
   o different graphical forms of the "rotary pointers" at the lower
     LCD line, since the graphics are not documented.
     Instead, always a vertical bar + the decimal value will be displayed


Additional Notes:
   o Meters are not supported by the Motormix protocol
   o MTC digits are not supported by the Motormix protocol
   o LEDrings normaly not supported by the Motormix protocol. The
     LEDring hack works only with Sonar, and not with Cubase
   o the two 7 segment digits have to be connected directly to the
     shift registers --- no multiplexing required
   o only one 2x40 LCD is supported by the Motormix protocol
   o tested with the MIDIbox NG hardware, buttons and LEDs are
     assigned according to the existing design. The mapping can be
     changed in mm_io_tables.inc
   o *IMPORTANT* since I'm a Logic user (and therefore prefer the
     Logic Control emulation), this application has only be tested
     with following demo programs:
        o Sonar 3 Producer Demo Edition
        o Cubase SX Demo V1.02
     No guarantee that it also works with other versions
   o Note for Cubase users: most buttons are not assigned to a
     function by default - you have to do this by hand in
     the device configuration! It seems that these functions don't
     have a LED feedback, but this could be different in newer
     Cubase versions. Please read also the "Remote Control Devices"
     Documentation which can be found at the Steinberg Website
