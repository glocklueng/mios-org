
MIDIO128 V2.2c
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o Update for MIOS V1.9g
     No change in application itself.


MIDIO128 V2.2b
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o Application can now be compiled for PIC18F4620 as well.
     No change in application itself.


MIDIO128 V2.2a
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o CC#123 with value 0 now also interpreted as "All Notes Off"
     command


MIDIO128 V2.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o application sources now compilable under Windows/MacOS/Linux
     See also http://www.midibox.org/dokuwiki/application_development

   o mk_midio_128 now part of the release package
     (-> tools/mk_midio128_syx directory)

   o Optionally, all digital outputs can now be switched to passive
     state with a CC#123 ("All Notes Off") event.
     This function is disabled by default, it has to be enabled by
     assigning it to a MIDI channel in the setup_midio128.asm file 
     (requires to rebuild and to upload a new .hex file), or it can 
     be changed in the midio128.ini file, converted to .syx and 
     uploaded to MIDIO128 with a common SysEx loader (see READMEs)


MIDIO128 V2.1d
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o MIDIO SysEx ID is now automatically derived from the MIOS Device ID


MIDIO128 V2.1d
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o MIDIO SysEx ID is now automatically derived from the MIOS Device ID


MIDIO128 V2.1b
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o the initial polarity of "toggle status" was wrong


MIDIO128 V2.1a
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o "program change" and "channel preassure" now sent correctly

   o the 42th and 84th DIN event now sent correctly

   o proper initialization for the case that the DOUTs are inverted 
     or the DINs are not inverted

   o change in default meta event handler (midio_meta.inc): 
     nothing will be sent if first byte is 0xff


MIDIO128 V2.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o three new SysEx commands have been implemented to simplify
     the configuration data up- and download. It's a block
     oriented format and therefore doesn't require delays between
     every byte anymore. This means, that data uploads can
     now also be realized without the use of MIDI-Ox so long the
     SysEx tool allows to insert delays between every block
     ("Delay after F7") - it should be 750 mS - thats the
     same requirement like for MIOS uploads.
     More infos can be found here:
        http://www.uCApps.de/howto_tools_mbsyx.html

   o the mk_midio128_syx.pl script has been updated to support the
     new upload format. It can be downloaded from here:
        http://www.uCApps.de/midio128/mk_midio128_syx.zip


MIDIO128 V2.0 - MIOS based version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o the complete MIDIO128 firmware has been ported to MIOS and is
     now running on a PIC18F452. For new projects it's recommented 
     to switch to the PIC18F452 because of the higher flexibility, 
     but also the update of an existing MIDIbox to MIOS makes sense 
     due to the new features - just only the processor and the 
     crystal have to be changed.
