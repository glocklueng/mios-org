MIDIbox CV V1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  o support for MBHP_AOUT_NG module

  o support for BankStick. 
    Up to 128 patches can be stored in a 32k BankStick (24LC256), 
    they can either be selected from the control surface, or via
    Program Change (channel assignable in main.asm)

    !!! IMPORTANT !!!
    BankStick at CS#0 will be formatted automatically if this hasn't
    been done before. This could lead to data loss if you upload
    the application into a MIDIbox which is normaly running with
    another firmware which accesses the BankStick (e.g. MBSID or MBSEQ)
    Solution: either remove the BankStick from core module, or 
    disable it in main.asm (-> DEFAULT_BANKSTICK_NUMBER 0)

  o added linear interpolation function which allows to smooth 
    the CV output curve by a configurable slew rate from 1 mS to 64 mS
    This feature is especially useful when CV outputs are controlled
    by 7bit velocity or CC values, as it gets use of the full 12bit
    resolution and reduces zipper noise dramatically.

  o legato/mono/poly mode setting now selectable for each channel seperately

  o main page now displays patch number, patch name and 8 animated
    (short-triggered) activity meters

  o there is now a DIN sync start/stop output available at pin C.1
    (CORE::J7:SC)

  o the DIN sync clock output is now located at pin C.0 by default
    (CORE::J7:RC, consistent with MBSEQ)

  o minor bugfixes


MIDIbox CV V1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  o support for MBHP_AOUT_LC module

  o a calibration menu page has been added

  o the gate polarity can now be changed seperately for each channel

  o an output curve can now be selected for each channel seperately
    Available curves: 1V/Oct, Hz/V, Inverted, Exponential

  o a clock output is now provided to generate pulses from an incoming
    MIDI clock. Provided rates: 24 ppqn / 1..16 and 96/46/32 ppqn (interpolated)
    The default pin is RD4 (Core Module, J14)
    The default pulsewidth is 1 mS
    Both settings can be changed in main.asm

  o NOTE: the 8 gate outputs are available at J5, this option is
    DISABLED by default, it has to be enabled by setting
    the ENABLE_J5 switch to 1 in main.asm

    This is to reduce the risk that somebody doesn't read the 
    documentation and uploads the firmware on a MIDIbox64 (or similar), 
    where J5 is used as pot input. A short circuit would happen which 
    could destroy the port drivers!


MIDIbox CV V1.0

  o initial version
