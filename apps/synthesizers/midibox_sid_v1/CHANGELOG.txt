MIDIboxSID V1.7303e
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o built for MIOS V1.9g (or higher) to support new encoder types.
     Rotary encoders won't work with older MIOS versions!


MIDIboxSID V1.7303b
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o the 4bit volume parameter of the SID can now be directly
     modulated from ENV2. This possibility allows to replace the
     oscillator envelopes and helps to overcome the ADSR bug.
     This feature can be enabled with the fourth flag (E2V) of the 
     "sound engine option"

   o with the fifth "sound engine option" GSA (gate stays active)
     the gate of the oscillators will not be cleared anymore if
     a MIDI note has been released.
     This allows to control the amplitude envelope of a sound
     completely via filter or E2V modulation independent from the
     OSC ADSR release rate.

   o the arpeggiator has been overworked, now the arp cycle has always
     a constant time. If one key is pressed, it is stepped with normal
     rate, with two keys at double rate, three keys triple rate, 
     four keys quadrupled rate. 
     This approach improves the live handling and yields more musical results
     If the arpeggiator is synched to MIDI clock, use following
     rate settings:
       - 64th note: 124
       - 32th note: 118
       - 16th note: 106
       - 8th note: 82
       - 4th note: 34


   o the filter control curve can now be scaled between a min
     and max range of 0..2047 - this is (currently) a static
     configuration which has to be made in the .asm file (search
     for DEFAULT_FILTER_TYPE).
     It's also possible to switch between two different types and
     calibration sets via an external pin (search for DEFAULT_FILTER_TYPE_SWITCH)

   o cosmetic change: displayed patch number now padded with zeros

   o The LCD now prints an informative message when a patch has been uploaded
     via SysEx


MIDIboxSID V1.7303
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o this version requires MIOS V1.9 or higher!
     It won't run with older MIOS versions, since the address space
     >= 0x7c00 is allocated

   o a new CC parameter for "sound engine options" has been added. 
     It provides up to 7 flags which allow to change the characteristic 
     of the sound engine and to save the settings within a patch.
     All currently available sound engine options (303, FIP and E2P -
     see below) can be changed in the new SEO menu

   o a 303 mode has been implemented which changes the characteristic
     of the filter, envelopes and wavetable sequencer so that the SID
     can be used to play TB303-typical bassline sequences.
     The details are described at http://www.ucapps.de/howto_sid_bassline.html

     The option has to be enabled with the first flag (303) of the 
     "sound engine option"

   o the filter output curve can now be optionally interpolated 
     in order to smooth modifications of the CC#46 cutoff value. 
     The interpolation can be activated with the second flag (FIP)
     of the "sound engine option"

   o an alternative portamento mode has been added, which uses ENV2
     to realize a constant time glide/slide.
     Best results can be achieved with Attack=rate,
     Decay/Sustain/Release=0, Curve > 32. This results into
     a shape which is similar to the charging/decharging curve 
     of a capacitor. Try this with SusKey and Legato enabled.
     This feature can be enabled with the third flag (E2P) of the 
     "sound engine option"

   o a new CC parameter for "filter key tracking" has been added (CC#116)

   o "ENABLE_AOUT 2" selects a low-cost AOUT module
     (currently it only outputs CutOff as 12bit value, once I got
     the Curtis chips I will do some experiments with 8bit CutOff
     and 8bit Resonance)

   o a new flag has been added to the MIDI sync parameter CC#125 which
     allows to send MIDI clock events from the wavetable sequencer. 
     Each step sends a clock in normal mode. 
     In 303 mode, each step sends 6 clocks

   o the internal WT editor now allows to modify the parameters
     of a whole track at once, this speeds up the initialisation
     of a new WT sequence. Just select the step position beyond 31
     ("All" will be print) and modify the Mod, #1, #2 or #3 column

   o the WT editor now marks parameters with a '!' so long they haven't
     been stored in EEPROM

   o the WT editor now prints notes/arpeggio keys/holds when the appr.
     WT parameter assignment is within the range CC#8..CC#12

   o it's now possible to play a note (or to start/stop a WT sequence)
     by holding one or multiple SID buttons and pressing the
     menu button. The selected SID number(s) will be inverted on
     screen so long the note (or sequence) is active.
     Note that the Note event could play different SIDs at the same
     time if they are assigned to the same MIDI channel.

   o each second LFO now provides a Sample & Hold functionality when
     switched to random mode. LFO2, 4 and 5 hold the waveform of
     LFO1, 3 and 5 for each period run.
     Example: 
        - in the modulation matrix, enable LFO2 modulation for the
          Pitch of OSC1 -> this is the S&H output
        - set LFO2 to random mode, Rate=70, Depth doesn't matter
        - set LFO1 to sine or random mode, and vary Rate and Depth

   o the LEDs of the modulation matrix are now also used for metering
     the output values of LFO1-6 and ENV1-2

     This new mode can be selected by pressing two mod target buttons
     at the same time (e.g. O1 and O2 pitch). It can also be enabled
     automatically after startup by changing the DEFAULT_LEDMATRIX_MODE
     setting in main.asm or setup_*.asm

   o support for 24LC512 EEPROMs - it has to be enabled with the
     DEFAULT_BS_TYPE flag in main.asm or setup_*.asm

   o a lot of minor bugfixes and improvements have been made


MIDIboxSID V1.7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o support for multiple BankSticks
     The bank can be changed 
        - with CC#0 at the selected MIDI channel (master and slaves)
        - with F0 00 00 7E 46 <device-number> 0B <bank> F7 (master only)
        - in the CFG menu (master and slaves)

   o when a Node in the Modulation Matrix is enabled/disabled, the
     CS changes to the appr. Envelope/LFO menu

   o the complete sound engine has been overworked to save memory

   o there is now a 6th LFO waveform which forwards analog conversion
     results from the first 6 analog inputs (J5 port of the core
     module) to the LFOs. 
     This allows you to control the SID with analog signals
     The LFO Depth controls the impact on the modulation target
     The LFO Rate controls the update cycle - a lower rates result to
     very stuttering effects, the highest rate (127 -> 812 uS sample
     period) to a very accurate control of Frequencies/Pulsewidths/Filter

     Thinkable analog sources are pots, joysticks, CV outs, ...

   o some minor bugfixes and improvements


MIDIboxSID V1.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o a split function has been implemented which allows to assign the
     three SID voices to different (or overlapping) keyboard zones.
     By using the transpose function in addition, you are now able
     to play each voice individually from a single MIDI channel.
     This feature is also usefull to layer multiple SID sounds to
     different keyboard zones (requires SID slaves)

   o the velocity/modulation/aftertouch configuration can now be found
     in a separate menu (VMA), the split function can be controlled
     from the CFG menu

   o an auto configuration for the SID device ID and the CS handler
     has been implemented which is enabled by default. The SID device 
     ID will be derived from the MIOS device ID. The control surface
     will be disabled if the device ID is != 0x00 (and therefore the
     core acts as a slave).
     This simplifies the configuration of a 4 SID system

   o several setup and .syx files for 6581/8580 with or without control 
     surface are included in this package so that in most cases no 
     assembler is required to configure the application

   o IMPORTANT: from now on, the SCLK input of the SID module has to
     be connected to port J10:MD (PIC Pin #28/RD5) of the core module

     The use of MIOS V1.7 is highly recommented (especially CS users
     will notice advantages - brighter LEDs, brighter modulation matrix!)
     see also http://www.ucapps.de/mios_v1_7_hardware_mods.html


MIDIboxSID V1.6 Alpha3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o the handling of SID Slave patch changes is faster now

   o Special Characters are now in a separate file (special_characters.inc)
     to simplify the use with different LCD drivers. The application
     gets use of the MIOS_BOX_CFG0_USE_GLCD flag to determine if a 
     character or graphical display is connected (requires MIOS V1.6 or higher)


MIDIboxSID V1.6 Alpha2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o menu handling has been slightly changed. The page scrolls now
     directly with the datawheel and not with the cursor anymore.
     If you like the old style, then enable the CS_MENU_OLD_STYLE
     switch within main.asm

   o Wavetable sequencer now properly reset when MIDI Sync enabled

   o support for optional CBM8580 filter switch (jumper) which can 
     be connected to pin RC.3 (CORE::J6::SI). This mechanism has 
     to be enabled with CBM8580_FILTER_SWITCH in main.asm --- 
     it's disabled by default! The pin number is free definable.
     A 10k pull-up should be added to this pin, this is already the
     case for RC.3 when you are using the original MBHP core module.
     Jumper open: 6581 filter, Jumper closed: 8580 filter


MIDIboxSID V1.6 Alpha1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o optional oscillator phase synchronization for more percussive
     sounds (idea by Jess D. Skov-Nielsen)
     New CS Menu Entry: OPS in the OSC menu

   o non-linear envelopes with flexible CURVE parameter which 
     allows you to bend the attack, decay and/or release curve to 
     upward/downward direction (idea and implementation hints
     by Jess D. Skov-Nielsen)
     See also: http://www.ucapps.de/midibox_sid/mbsid_curve1.jpg
               http://www.ucapps.de/midibox_sid/mbsid_curve2.jpg
               http://www.ucapps.de/midibox_sid/mbsid_curve3.jpg
     New CS Menu entries: Cur and CAs in the ENV menu

   o optimized linear response of the 8580 filter (implementation
     hints by Jess D. Skov-Nielsen)
     NOTE: due to the higher dynamic range, you've to increase the
     CutOff value of the old patches

   o correctly calculated Note->frequency table (implementation
     hints by Jess D. Skov-Nielsen)

   o more stable wavetable sequencer timings (based on experiences 
     with MIDIbox SEQ)

   o optimized display handler to avoid long delays of more 
     than 1 mS

   o experimental AOUT support (7 CV out assigned to the existing 
     outputs of the modulation matrix, 1 channel to the filter 
     resonance parameter). For the final version it's planned
     to integrate the AOUT into a separate modulation matrix,
     and to add new CC's to a separate AOUT channel


MIDIboxSID V1.5b
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o Most parts of the software engine have been revised in order to
     improve the sound quality. The most drastic change has been made 
     in the pitch modulation - now it works independent from the 
     "Pitch Range" setting; LFO and envelope waveforms are added 
     linearly to the frequency like known from common synthesizers. 
     The depth parameter of LFOs & Envelopes follows an exponential 
     curve. Unfortunately these changes make V1.5 incompatible to 
     patches which have been created with the old firmwares

   o the filter driver of the software engine has been significantly 
     improved for the 8580. A MP3 example can be found under 
     MBHP->MIDIbox SID->Design

   o the arpeggiator now sorts the pressed keys from the lowest to 
     the highest note in order to improve the usability during a 
     live session

   o -> CC#8 - CC#11 allow to play notes with the wavetable sequencer 
     and to combine it also with the arpeggiator in order to realize 
     complex polyphonic textures. An MP3 example can be found under 
     MBHP->MIDIbox SID->Design

   o the Wavetable Sequencer/Arpeggiator, LFOs and Envelopes can be 
     optionally synchronized to the MIDI clock (-> CC#125)

   o a MIDI clock start command (FA) now resets all LFOs

   o the LFO now provides an additional pseudo random waveform

   o to-COM interface now officially supported

   o Control Surface: all new parameters have been integrated into 
     the menu structure

   o The JSynth based editor has been updated

   o The presets patches have been updated - 
     76 sounds/sequencers/arpeggiator textures are available now


MIDIboxSID V1.4/18FStepC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o The third and last step supports a lot of rotary encoders, buttons and LEDs.
     See also MBHP->MIDIbox SID->Step C


MIDIboxSID V1.4/18FStepB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o The second step allows to control up to 4 SIDs from one control unit.
     See also MBHP->MIDIbox SID->Step B


MIDIboxSID V1.4/18FStepA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o The first step of the control surface has been finished.
     See also MBHP->MIDIbox SID->Control Unit 


MIDIboxSID V1.4/18F
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o Port to PIC18F452 as MIOS application, will provide a control surface later.
