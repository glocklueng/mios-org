Okay, for coming here I'll give you a cookie! Here you go:


A grade school teacher was asking his pupils what their parents 
did for a living. "Tim, you be first. What does your mother do 
all day?". Tim stood up and proudly said, "She's a doctor."
"That's wonderful. How about you, Amy?" Amy shyly stood up, 
scuffed her feet and said, "My father is a mailman." "Thank you, 
Amy" said the teacher. "What does your parent do, Billy?" Billy 
proudly stood up and announced, "My daddy plays piano in a whore-
house."

The teacher was aghast and went to Billy's house and rang the bell. 
Billy's father answered the door. The teacher explained what his 
son had said and demanded an explanation. Billy's dad said, "I'm 
actually a system programmer specializing in TCP/IP communication 
protocol on UNIX systems. How can I explain a thing like that to 
a seven-year-old?"
