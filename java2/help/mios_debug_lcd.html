The LCD Message tab provides a graphical front-end to 'Command 08' of the MIOS SysEx Implementation.
<p><img src="images/debug_lcd.png">
<p>The text input box is where the LCD text message is written and sent by pressing the "Send LCD Message" button. There are three options for sending an LCD message:
<ol>
	<li>Clear Sreen: Clears the LCD, starts a message (display will not be updated for the next 2 seconds). The text message is optional, it contains additional characters which are print immediately from position 0/0<br><br></li>
	<li>Current Cursor Position: Starts a message (display will not be updated for the next 2 seconds). The text message is optional, it contains characters which will be printed immediately from the current cursor position.<br><br></li>
	<li>Co-ordinates: Sets the cursor and starts a message (display will not be updated for the next 2 seconds). The text message is optional, it contains additional characters which will be printed immediately from the new cursor position that is set with the X/Y spin boxes<br><br></li>
</ol>

The "Stop LCD Message" button stops a message immediately, the USER_DISPLAY_Init routine will be invoked which reinitializes the LCD screen.

<p>NOTE: every command will cause that the USER_DISPLAY_Init routine will be invoked within 2 seconds after the last LCD command has been received

<p>NOTE2: these commands are also used by MIOS itself when display type #06 has been selected

<p>NOTE3: these commands are also received by MBHP_TV
